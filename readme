To display all the network IP addresses and corresponding hostnames using Python, you can utilize the socket module. Here's an example script:

python

import socket

def get_host_info():
    # Get the hostname of the current machine
    hostname = socket.gethostname()

    # Get the IP addresses and hostnames of all network interfaces
    ip_addresses = []
    hostnames = []

    # Iterate over all network interfaces
    for interface in socket.if_nameindex():
        interface_name = interface[1]
        try:
            # Get the IP address of the interface
            ip = socket.gethostbyname(interface_name)
            ip_addresses.append(ip)

            # Get the hostname of the IP address
            hostname = socket.gethostbyaddr(ip)[0]
            hostnames.append(hostname)
        except socket.error:
            # Skip interfaces that cannot be resolved
            continue

    return ip_addresses, hostnames

# Call the function to get the IP addresses and hostnames
ip_addresses, hostnames = get_host_info()

# Display the IP addresses and hostnames
for ip, hostname in zip(ip_addresses, hostnames):
    print(f"IP Address: {ip}\tHostname: {hostname}")

When you run this script, it will retrieve the IP addresses and hostnames of all the network interfaces on your machine and display them on the console.

Please note that some IP addresses or hostnames may not be resolved if the DNS lookup fails or if the network interface is not connected. Additionally, the script might require administrative privileges to access certain network information.
